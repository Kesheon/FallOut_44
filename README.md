# FallOut_44 

# FallOut44 is a text-based adventure game based off of the 2015 triple A game: Fallout 4.

# It starts out in the year 2077. Your name is Nate Mcpherson. You served in the Special

# Forces from 2073-2076 during world war 3 for the

# USA. You operated a mechanical suit called, "Power Armor": Iron Man without lasers or flying.

# As the war continued on: you had retired and settled down in the northeastern part

# of America with your family. You lived in the CommonWealth/Massachusetts: in a

# neighborhood called, "Sanctuary Hills".

# Your wife is Nora Mcpherson. Together you two had an infant son whom the two of you

# named, Shaun. The date was October 23, 2077. You, a retired soldier, and your wife, a

# lawyer: were going to go to the park with your infant son, Shaun. However, a disturbing

# news report came on that morning. Reports were coming in that nuclear attacks were

# happening world wide. World war 3 had reached it's climax. Fortunately, you signed up

# for a program named Vault Tec earlier that morning: your wife insisted you sign up for

# it. Vault Tec, for years, had been selling spots to people to live in an underground

# vault in the event of a nuclear war. So, you and your family rushed to the underground

# vault: Vault 111, with nothing but the clothes on your backs. Anyone who did not have a Vault-Tec

# membership either died in the nuclear blast or miracously survived. Before going deeper

# into Vault 111: Vault-Tec scientist required everyone to be put into their own individual

# cryogenic pods for, "decontamination". However, your wife was allowed to keep your son,

# Shaun, with her, as Shaun was just an infant and could fit in the pod with another person.

# The Vault-Tec scientists closed everyone's cryogenic pod, but never unfroze them. It was

# an evil experiment. And the world was blown up by nuclear weapons, so no government could

# stop them. You wake up in your pod one day and see a man in a black leather coat with a

# "big white gun" alongside two people in biohazard suits. They opened your wife's cryogenic

# pod: hers was in front of yours. The man in the black leather coat demanded your wife to

# hand over your infant son, Shaun. Your wife refused. So the man in black leather coat shot

# your wife with the "big white gun" and took your infant son, Shaun. The man in black closed

# your wife's pod and looked at you and said, "at least we still have the back up." He then

# re-froze your cryogenic pod: leaving with your infant son, Shaun, and the two people in

# biohazard suits. You one day are mysteriously released from your cryogenic pod. Your wife

# is dead inside of her cryogenic pod in front of you, and your son, Shaun was kidnapped. You

# find out by looking at computers in Vault 111 that the date is October 23, 2287. You have

# been inside of the underground vault: Vault 111, for 210 years, but don't know what year your wife was

# killed and your son kidnapped. Because you were re-frozen after that happened. But you hope

# it happened recently and set out into the post-apocalyptic wasteland seeking two things:

# revenge and most importantly your son, Shaun.
